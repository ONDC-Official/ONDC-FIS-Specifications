## Introduction

Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a network based on beckn open protocol and will enable local commerce across segments, such as financial services, mobility, retail etc, to be discovered and engaged by any network-enabled application.

ONDC financial services aims to build a nationwide multi-modal network that provides seamless experiences, supports growth & innovation by,

- bringing together a diverse set of financial services players who can engage with the open network on their own terms
- fostering collaboration, sharing & new models
- facilitating responsive policy by bringing onboard decision making authorities

In the financial service space, the intent is to enable seamless and truly interoperatable service options by bringing in diverse inventory onboard at scale that will serve the countryâ€™s population.
