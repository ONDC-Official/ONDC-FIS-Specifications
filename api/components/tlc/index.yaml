code:
  - Term: Static Terms (Buyer App)
    Api: search on_search init on_init confirm on_confirm
    Attribute: BAP_TERMS.STATIC_TERMS
    Owner: Buyer App
    Value: URL
    Description: This will be the URL of a web-page where the standard Terms and Conditions of the Network Participant - which are not covered in the API Specification (e.g. indemnity) - will be hosted. These terms will apply to the transaction, in addition to the terms decided through the ONDC Protocol. If there is a conflict between the terms decided through the Protocol, and the Static Terms, the terms decided through the ONDC Protocol will prevail. Also, if there is a conflict between the Static Terms and the ONDC Network Policy or the Static Terms and the Network Participant Agreement, the terms of the ONDC Network Policy or the Network Participant Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail.
  - Term: Offline Contract (Buyer App)
    Api: search on_search init on_init confirm on_confirm
    Attribute: BAP_TERMS.OFFLINE_CONTRACT
    Owner: Buyer App
    Value: true/ false
    Description: OFFLINE_CONTRACT is a boolean field denoting the presence or absence of an offline contract between Network Participants (NPs). When set to true, it indicates the existence of a formalized contract outside of transaction-level agreements. This offline contract holds precedence over transaction-level contracts, governing the relationship between the involved NPs. Conversely, when set to false, it suggests that contractual arrangements are solely based on transaction-level contracts, without overarching offline agreements.
