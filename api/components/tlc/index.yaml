    Attribute: BUYER_FINDER_FEE_TYPE
    Owner: Buyer App
    Value: '"amount", "percent- annualized", "percent"'
    Description: >-
      If set to "amount" it means Buyer App's fee is a flat amount in INR.
      If set to "percent" it means Buyer Appâ€™s fee is an absolute percentage 
      of the total loan amount

      If set to "percent- annualized" it means the Buyer App's fee is set as a
      percentage of the Total Loan Disbursed for a 12-month tenure loan.


      For example: Assume the Buyer App Fees' value is 5%


      For a 12 month tenure loan the 'effective fees' paid by Seller App to the
      Buyer App would be 5% * (12 months/ 12 months) i.e 5%


      For 6 month tenure loan the 'effective fees' paid by Seller App to the
      Buyer App would be 5% * (6 months/ 12 months) i.e 2.5%


      For 18 month tenure loan the 'effective fees' paid by Seller App to the
      Buyer App would be 5% * (18 months/ 12 months) i.e 7.5%

    Attribute: DELAY_INTEREST
    Owner: Receiver (BAP or BPP)
    Value: Positive Decimal Number
    Description: >-
      This is the annual rate of interest that the Payment Collector will be
      charged if they delay a payment to the counterparty Network Participant,
      calculated pro rata for each calendar day of delay. As an example, if the
      value is set as "7.3", and the amount of payment due is INR 1000, that
      will mean the Payment Collector will pay the counterparty Network
      Participant an interest of 7.3% per annum (i.e. INR 100), calculated pro
      rata for each day of delay. So if the Payment Collector delay was 50 days,
      the total interest payable would be INR 10 [calculated as
      1000x(7.3/100)x(50/365)]

      Protocol will prevail. Also, if there is a conflict between the Static
      Terms and the ONDC Network Policy or the Static Terms and the Network
      Participant Agreement, the terms of the ONDC Network Policy or the Network
      Participant Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail.
