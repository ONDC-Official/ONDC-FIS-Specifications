# XInput

This XInput schema facilitates seamless communication between buyers and sellers by allowing the exchange of additional information through forms.
Sellers can request specific details using custom forms, and buyers respond with the necessary information, ensuring a smooth transaction process.
The differentiation in MIME types and additional settings, such as resubmit and multiple submissions, adds flexibility to the form interaction between participants.

## Seller-Side Form:

```
{
  "xinput": {
    "head": {
      "descriptor": {
        "name": "Form Details"
      },
      "index": {
        "min": 0,
        "cur": 0,
        "max": 0
      },
      "headings": ["Form Details"]
    },
    "form": {
      "id": "<Form_ID>",
      "mime_type": "<MIME_Type>",
      "url": "<Form_URL>",
      "multiple_sumbissions": <Multiple_Sumbissions_Flag>
    },
    "required": true
  }
}
```

- `head`: Contains basic details regarding the form such as form name, index.

  - `name`: Describes the form name.
  - `index`: Specifies the minimum, current, and maximum indexes.
    - `min`: Minimum index value.
    - `cur`: Current index value.
    - `max`: Maximum index value.
  - `headings`: Array containing all the form headings.

- `form`: Represents the form itself.

  - `id`: Unique ID associated with the form.
  - `mime_type`: Type of MIME.
  - `url`: Endpoint where the form is hosted.
  - `multiple_sumbissions`: Indicates whether multiple submissions are allowed.

 ### mime_type: 
 Describes the type of MIME.It can be one of the thee possible values: application/html or text/html or text/html-multi. 
  - **text/html**: If the value of mime_type is text/html, then the buyer app renders a form presented in HTML format. The rendered HTML-based form structure looks like this:

````html
<form action="/form/submission-path">
  <label for="dob">Date of Birth</label>
  <input type="date" id="dob" name="dob" />
  <label for="panValue">PAN Number</label>
  <input type="text" id="panValue" name="panValue" />
  <input type="hidden" id="formId" name="formId" value="<Form_ID>" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
````

The form gets submitted at the specified path in action. On submission, if successful, the buyer is provided with a submission_id.

```shell
{
  "submission_id": "f5a9f4fe-fc3a-4432-aa2d-d397724a5061"
}
```

If an error occurs while submitting the form, then with an appropriate error code, a message will be sent as part of response.

```shell
{
  "message": {
    "ack": {
      "status": "NACK"
    }
  },
  "error": {
    "code": "07",
    "message": "Data sent in request is not correct"
  }
}
```

Note: While submitting text/html form, API headers will contain [Content-Type:"multipart/form-data"].

  - **application/html**:

On the other hand, if the mime_type is set to application/html, the seller provides a link to an external HTML page where the buyer can submit the required information.

  - **text/html-multi**:
If the form type is text/html-multi, the buyer app can include multiple form fields similar to the original form, allowing for the addition of extra details. 
This form is sent by the seller app.
````html
<form action="/form/submission-path" method="POST" >
  <label for="dob">Date of Birth</label>
  <input type="date" id="dob" name="dob" />
  <label for="panValue">PAN Number</label>
  <input type="text" id="panValue" name="panValue" />
  <input type="hidden" id="formId" name="formId" value="<Form_ID>" />
  <input type="button" value="Submit" />
</form>
````
The buyer app can dynamically add multiple form fields as needed.
For example:

````html
<form action="/form/submission-path" method="POST" >
  <label for="dob">Date of Birth</label>
  <input type="date" id="dob" name="dob" />
  <label for="panValue">PAN Number</label>
  <input type="text" id="panValue" name="panValue" />

  <!-- dynamically added fields -->
  <label for="dob">Date of Birth</label>
  <input type="date" id="dob1" name="dob1" />
  <label for="panValue">PAN Number</label>
  <input type="text" id="panValue1" name="panValue1" />


  <input type="hidden" id="formId" name="formId" value="<Form_ID>" />
  <input type="button" value="Submit" />
</form>
````
When submitting the form, make sure that the payload follows this required format, values for dynamically added fields like dob and panValue positioned at the first index. The seller app will use this same structure to extract the values.
```
  {
      "dob": ["17/11/2021", "19/12/2003"],
      "panValue": ["RKPUS3413T", "SKPUS3413L"]
  }
  
```

   

## Form response

There are 2 possible ways to get the latest status after submitting a form

1. #### Form response for text/html
   On successfull submission the buyer is provided with a submission_id, which the buyer can use to send as part of next call.

```shell
{
  "xinput": {
    "form_response": {
      "status": "<Status>",
      "submission_id": "<Submission_ID>"
    }
  }
}
```


- `form_response`: Represents the form info after submitting a form.

  - `status`: Denotes the latest state of the form after submission. Possible values include SUCCESS, PENDING, REJECTED, APPROVED.
  - `submission_id`: Contains the unique ID that the buyer receives upon successful form submission.

2. #### Form response for application/html
   To provide the buyer with latest form status, seller sends an unsolicated on_status call with Submission_ID. Additionally, if the seller doesn't sends an unsolicated call, the buyer can request the latest form status by sending a status call with the ref_id.

```shell
{
  "xinput": {
    "form_response": {
      "status": "<updated_status>",
      "submission_id": "<Submission_ID>"
    }
  }
}
```

- The seller responds with the latest status of submitted form corresponding to the submission_id ("Submission_ID") that was submitted earlier by the buyer.
