### Fulfillment (Recurring: SIP, SWP)

After the order is accepted, seller app performs the processing and responds with the state of order processing (fulfillment)

```mermaid

    autonumber
    participant bap AS Distributor
    participant bpp AS AMC/Aggregator
    alt sip started
        bpp ->> bap: `/on_status` w/ fulfillment in `ONGOING` state
    else sip completed
        bpp ->> bap: `/on_status` w/ fulfillment in `COMPLETED` state
    else sip cancelled
        bpp ->> bap: `/on_status` w/ fulfillment in `CANCELLED` state
    end
```

For recurring orders, seller app creates a new order for every instalment and it goes through the entire order lifecycle.

```mermaid

    participant bap AS Distributor
    participant bpp AS AMC/Aggregator
    bpp ->> bap: `/on_confirm` w/ child order in `ACCEPTED` state

    rect rgb(191, 223, 255)
    alt payment successful
        bpp ->> bap: `/on_status` w/ child order payment in `PAID` state
    else payment failed
        bpp ->> bap: `/on_status` w/ child order payment in `NOT_PAID` state
    end
    end
```
