##### Motor Insurance:

1.  Added manual review flag as part of on_search. This is added to
    > allow the buyer app to improve the buyer journey by filtering
    > policies where manual review is not required.

**Example Snippet:**

```
"tags": [
 {
   "descriptor": {
     "name": "General Information",
     "code": "GENERAL_INFO"
   },
   "list": [
     {
       "descriptor": {
         "code": "MANUAL_REVIEW",
         "name": "Manual Review",
         "short_desc": "Describes manual review value”
       },
       "value": "true"
     }
   ]
}
]
```

2.  Added following optional fields as part of renewal form. This is
    > added to allow the seller app and buyer app to share previous
    > policy details when the seller is unable to fetch data from the
    > Vahan
    > portal.<img src="media/image4.png" style="width:2.49479in;height:1.98395in" />

    - <u>Case 1</u>: The buyer app choose to send optional details
      > upfront to the seller app

      - Here the seller app has previous policy details therefore even
        > if the vahan portal is not returning the data seller app can
        > use the data shared by the buyer app to generate offers.

    - <u>Case 2</u>: The buyer app chose not to send optional details
      > upfront to the seller app

      - <u>Sub case 1</u> : Previous Policy details were not received
        > from Vahan portal

        - The seller app will NACK the submission of the form with the
          > error code “81208”, Event: “Previous Policy Details
          > Required”. In this scenario the buyer app will collect the
          > optional fields and submit the entire form again.

      - <u>Sub case 2</u>: Previous Policy details were received from
        > Vahan portal

        - The seller app shares the submission ID for the form
          > submission with the buyer app.

3.  <span class="mark">Added IDV_VALUE, IDV_MIN_VALUE, and IDV_MAX_VALUE
    > to the on_search feature. This is added to allow the seller to
    > share the IDV range supported and for the buyer to share the IDV
    > desired by the buyer which shall be within the range shared by the
    > seller.</span>

    - Based on IDV_MIN_VALUE & IDV_MAX_VALUE the buyer app will allow
      > users to set custom IDV value.

**Example Snippet:**

```
"tags": [
 {
   "descriptor": {
     "name": "General Information",
     "code": "GENERAL_INFO"
   },
   "list": [
     {
       "descriptor": {
         "code": "IDV_VALUE",
         "name": "IDV Value",
         "short_desc": "Describes the IDV value"
       },
       "value": "350000"
     },
     {
       "descriptor": {
         "code": "IDV_MIN_VALUE",
         "name": "IDV Min Value",
         "short_desc": "Describes the IDV's min value"
       },
       "value": "150000"
     },
     {
       "descriptor": {
         "code": "IDV_MAX_VALUE",
         "name": "IDV Max Value",
         "short_desc": "Describes the IDV' max value"
       },
       "value": "500000"
     }
   ]
```

- IDV_SELECTED as part of the select call will be shared. The buyer app
  > will send the selected IDV value as part of tags & in on_select the
  > seller app will send the value as part of IDV_VALUE.

**Example snippet:**

```
"tags": [
 {
   "descriptor": {
     "name": "General Information",
     "code": "GENERAL_INFO"
   },
   "list": [
     {
       "descriptor": {
         "code": "IDV_SELECTED",
         "name": "IDV Selected"
       },
       "value": "350000"
     }
   ]
 }
]
```
